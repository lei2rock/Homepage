Hi, I'm Donglei. 

Ph.D. candidate in Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics at CUHK Business School advised by [Prof. Xiaoquan Zhang](http://mikezhang.com/) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Xia](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuxia2014/). 

My research interests span the fields of applied microeconometrics, and I am recently interested in the topic about pollution regulation, carbon emission allowance trading and social welfare.
