Hi, I’m Donglei.

Ph.D. candidate in Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics at CUHK Business School advised by [Prof. Xiaoquan Zhang](http://mikezhang.com/) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Xia](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuxia2014/).

My research interests span the fields of applied microeconometrics, and I am recently interested in the topic about pollution regulation, carbon emission allowance trading and social welfare.

I come from [Pujiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujiang_County,_Zhejiang), a beautiful county in Zhejiang Province of China. My nickname is *BanBan*, and my friends also like to call me *LeiLei*.  Whenever I am not doing research, I love to read [books](https://blog.dlzhang.com/books/) and watch [documentaries](https://blog.dlzhang.com/posts/546f324b/), and [dramas](https://blog.dlzhang.com/posts/f90d4bca). <!-- more -->
