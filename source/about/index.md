　　Hi, I’m Donglei, Ph.D. candidate in Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics at CUHK Business School, advised by [Prof. Xiaoquan Zhang](http://mikezhang.com/) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Xia](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuxia2014/). I am an alumnus of Zhejiang University and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

　　My research interests span the fields of applied microeconometrics, and I am recently interested in the topic about pollution regulation, carbon emission allowance trading and social welfare.

　　I come from [Pujiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujiang_County,_Zhejiang), a beautiful county in Zhejiang Province of China. My nickname is _BanBan_, and my friends also like to call me _LeiLei_. Whenever I am not doing research, I love to read books and watch documentaries, and dramas.
