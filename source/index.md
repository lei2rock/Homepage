　　I’m Zhang Donglei (张栋磊), and use Banban as my online handle. My hometown [Pujiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujiang_County,_Zhejiang) is a very beautiful city in Zhejiang Province, China. 

　　I am now a Ph.D. candidate in Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics at CUHK Business School advised by [Prof. Zhang Xiaoquan](http://mikezhang.com/) and [Prof. Xia Xiaoyu](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuxia2014/). I am also an alumnus of Zhejiang University and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

　　My research interests span the fields of applied microeconometrics, and I am recently interested in the topic about pollution regulation, carbon emission allowance trading and social welfare. Whenever I am not doing research, I love to read books, and watch documentaries and dramas.
